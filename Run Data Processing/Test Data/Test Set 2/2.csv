For Task [Field-Choice_Task_Num], you will be asked to calculate the sums of sets of five randomly chosen two-digit numbers as before.



You will be given a choice in how you wish to allocate earnings from this task. You may choose any combination of the previous payment schemes; that is, you may choose what percentage of your earnings will be determined by each of the payment schemes. Your combination must sum to 100%.



For example, if you chose 40% for Piece-Rate, 30% for Other-Tournament Rate, and 30% for Self-Tournamen Rate, then 40% of your earnings will be paid piece-rate, 30% of your earnings will depend on your performance relative to another randomly-chosen participant's Task 2 performance, and 30% of your earnings will depend on your performance relative to your own Task 2 performance.



Example: Earnings per correct solution with 60% Piece-Rate, 20% Other-Tournament Rate, and 20% Self-Tournament Rate. - Piece-Rate","Task [Field-Choice_Task_Num]: Choice Task
