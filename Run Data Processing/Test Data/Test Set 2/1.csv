Please read these instructions carefully. You may earn an additional payment of [Field-Comprehension_Payment] for each question about the instructions that you correctly answer. You will have two attempts for each question.



In this online experiment, there are three scenarios. Each scenario involves two participants: you, and one other participant that you will be randomly grouped with. Because there are three scenarios, you may be grouped with three other unique participants. You will never learn any information about the identity of your group members for any scenario, such as their name, age, or gender.


For each scenario, you and the other participant will be randomly assigned the roles of Player 1 or Player 2. Since you may be assigned either role, you will be asked to make decisions for all scenarios in which you could be Player 1 or Player 2. These decisions will influence the payoffs received by both you and the other participant.



At the end of the study, one of the three scenarios will be randomly selected for implementation and payment purposes. The decisions you made in the randomly-selected scenario will determine your and the other participant’s payoffs.



Comprehension Question

You may only proceed once you answer the question correctly.
